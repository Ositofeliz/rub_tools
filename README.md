# Random Useful Bioinformatics Tools (RUB Tools)

A collection of scripts and pipelines created for various bioinformatics data manipulations. These tools aim to provide reusable solutions for common challenges faced in bioinformatics workflows.

## Introduction and welcome

This is a collection of random scripts that I developped during various and random tasks, that might help someone one day, students, biologists, or maybe even real bioinformaticians (but mostly me because I keep forgetting what I did in the past).

The scripts here may already exist in a better version somewhere else (or might exist later), they are just things that I developped in certain situations and I thought it could help to share them.

They are not thought to be the most effective in computational time or to be space efficient, but to complete simple goals in manipulating common bioinformatic data formats.
Nevertheless, they are well commented to help anyone understand what is happening in the code.

Some folders may also contains markdown files with commonly used command lines to help people handle the tools and extract information, describing the options used. Such file are what I learned while discovering the tools and wished I knew before having to explore the manuals.

I'll add scripts and tips throughout time based on my current work if I feel it might help.

If anyone desperate enough ends up here, welcome and feel free to share your point of view, ideas, modifications, or whatever you deem interesting to contribute helping in the gruesome but fun task of handling bioinformatics files !

That's it, one script. I might one day check all the random things I did during my PhD to add them here, and from now, I'll make sure to keep this updated.
